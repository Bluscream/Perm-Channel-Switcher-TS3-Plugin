Permanent Channel Switcher (PermChanSwitcher)

Purpose:
Attempt to switch to any new pseudo-randomly selected channel permanently in a very short time (~50ms) until the user initiates to stop the process.
This works both for the local client and also remote users. Note that in order to use this with remote users, you need to have administrative server rights.

Warning: Use this only if you are server administrator, otherwise there is a risk on being kicked/banned. Currently the switch process can only be used
for a single user at the same time.
